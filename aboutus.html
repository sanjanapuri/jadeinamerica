      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <!--Add Links -->
      <p class ="small">In 2011, we founded Jade in America around the simple philosophy that jewelry making should be local and ethical. Our pieces are designed by an expert team at our studio in New York using jade sourced from the Granite Mountains of Wyoming. Then, the designs and components are sent to our manufacturing house in Lexington, Kentucky where they are later distributed at our locations in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Boston and Miami. Our process begins and ends in the USA.</p>
      <p class = "small">Our pieces are inspired by natural landscapes and serve as a testament to the age-old beauty of our national parks and other precious geographical wonders. We are committed to sustainability and environmental consciousness and to that end we are a certified member of the Responsible Jewelry Council, the leading authority on sustainable jewelry practices. In addition, 10% of profits are donated to the Earth Island Institute and Ocean Conservancy to ensure that these treasured sites remain as majestic for generations to come.</p>

      <h2>Our Beginning</h2>
      <img src="ourfounder.jpg" align="right" width="320" height="345">
      <p class ="small" class = "responsive">Jade in America was founded by CJ Ziegler in 2011 following her graduation from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Massachusetts. It sprung from her realization that there was a lack of local artisans engaging in ethical jade jewelry making. She sought to remedy this and assembled a group of designers and jewelry makers and they got to work at Jade in Americaâ€™s first home in the Back Bay. Jade in America now conducts business in five cities and is the first of its kind in its unique designs and passion for the environment.</p>
